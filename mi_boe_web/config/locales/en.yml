  how_does_it_work:
    content_1: "In Mi BOE any user can search in the documents of the Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado. The results are returned ordered by their relevance according to the specified search terms. Furthermore, it offers categorical filtering to make navigation and information retrieval easier."
    content_2: "For registered users, we offer extra functionality. We allow them to define searches that will be run daily through the most recent BOE publication. If relevant results are found, it will alert the user by e-mail. This way, we hope that the user can avoid the daily task of searching in the BOE, through the official portal or the official subscription system, which are not very user-friendly."
